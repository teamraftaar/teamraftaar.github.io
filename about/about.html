			<p>We are the Human Powered Vehicle Team consisting of undergraduate students who aim to give the world an alternative solution to the present-day energy crisis.
			</p>
			<p>We study, design, develop, and manufacture the <b>fully-faired recumbent bikes and trikes</b> which can reach up to the highest speeds of <b>60 kmph</b> solely by human power!!! The team rigorously researches about the human-powered vehicles and uses the best possible design, the best possible techniques, and the best possible materials for manufacturing.</p>
			<p>From building fairing completely from <b>carbon fiber</b> to incorporating the internationally acclaimed <b>landing gear</b> system in the vehicle, Team Raftaar is redefining the way human-powered vehicles are perceived in India. Our unique manufacturing style, innovative design, detailed analysis, and advanced use of <b>composites</b> have been appreciated and awarded multiple times both in National and international competitions.  </p>
			<p>With each passing year, we as a team are getting closer and closer to our ultimate ambition of bringing HPVs closer to the everyday commuters as a sustainable alternative to other conventional modes of transport.</p>
